Build a complete invoice management web app with the following features:

General Setup:
- This will be used by only one company. No signup, no login, no user management required.
- Keep it simple, lightweight, and optimized for hosting on GitHub + Render.com.
- Provide full frontend + backend code in a way that can be zipped and deployed easily.
- At the end, also generate and provide a ready ZIP file of the project that I can download directly.

Company Details:
- Company info (name, address, phone, email, logo) should be added once in the settings section.
- These details should automatically appear on every invoice, shown lightly (transparent watermark style) under the header area.

Invoice Features:
- Header section: Invoice number, issue date, due date, and currency (PKR, USD, EURO, GBP).
- Project rows: Each row must have Title, Description, Unit Price, Quantity (optional), Discount (optional).
- Discount should have 2 options: either fixed amount or percentage.
- Auto-calculation for each row: (Unit Price × Quantity – Discount).
- Subtotal + optional Tax + Grand Total should be calculated automatically.
- Deposit feature: Allow setting a required percentage deposit (e.g. 50%). Show calculated deposit, paid amount, and remaining balance.
- Highlight **Remaining Balance** more strongly than subtotal or deposit. (Remaining balance should appear in blue, not the entire box).
- Payment section: Manual bank account info can be entered by the company to display on invoices (no PayPal integration for now).

Sales Tracking:
- Sales dashboard should show total number of invoices, total sales, total paid, and total remaining balance.
- Ability to filter by paid/unpaid invoices.

Client Management:
- When creating a new invoice, allow adding client info (name, phone, email).
- Save each client in a simple client list (local database).
- When generating a new invoice, previously saved clients should appear as selectable.

Notes Section:
- Allow adding notes (instructions, special messages, etc.) to each invoice.

UI Requirements:
- Clean, professional layout.
- Blue strip headers with white text for invoice table columns.
- Payment info bar (Remaining Balance) should be highlighted in blue background, white text.
- Make sure invoices are downloadable as PDF and shareable via link.

Extra:
- All amounts should display without decimals (e.g. Rs 5000 instead of Rs 5000.00).
- Provide source code as a downloadable ZIP file at the end.
- Code must run perfectly on GitHub + Render.com without modification.
